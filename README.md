# **README** 

**This folder contains files related to a project that visualizes SpO2 and breathing rates, detects sleep apnea, and integrates an Arduino-based hardware component. Below is the detailed flow of implementation and description of each file.**

## **File Descriptions**

### **1\. `index.html`**

**This is the main HTML file for the website. It serves as the structure for displaying the graphical chart of SpO2 and breathing rates. The website also provides an indication of whether sleep apnea has been detected based on the monitored parameters.**

### **2\. `style.css`**

**This file contains the styling information for the website, ensuring the graphical chart and other elements are displayed in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly manner.**

### **3\. `script.js`**

**This JavaScript file implements the functionality of the website. It processes the data for SpO2 and breathing rates, renders the graphical charts, and performs the logic for sleep apnea detection.**

### **4\. `tinker.py`**

**This Python file contains the code for the mobile or desktop application created as part of this project. The application interacts with the Arduino device to collect and display the data.**

### **5\. `jeenehnidunga.ino`**

**This is the Arduino sketch file that runs on the hardware component. It collects SpO2 and breathing rate data from the sensors and sends the data to the application or website for visualization and processing.**

### **6\. `CIRCUIT.pdf`**

**This PDF file contains a snapshot of the circuit diagram used in the hardware implementation of this project.**

### **7\. `APP.pdf`**

**This PDF file shows the output or interface of the application created using `tinker.py`.**

## **Flow of Implementation**

1. **Hardware Setup: The Arduino hardware is set up as per the circuit diagram provided in `CIRCUIT.pdf`. The `jeenehnidunga.ino` file is uploaded to the Arduino to collect and transmit sensor data.**  
2. **Data Processing: The data collected from the hardware is sent to the Python application (`tinker.py`) or directly to the website for visualization.**  
3. **Visualization:**  
   * **The website uses `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` to display real-time graphical charts for SpO2 and breathing rates.**  
   * **The Python application displays similar data and provides additional features, as captured in `APP.pdf`.**  
4. **Detection of Sleep Apnea:**  
   * **The logic for detecting sleep apnea is implemented in `script.js` for the website.**  
   * **A similar detection mechanism is likely implemented in `tinker.py` for the application.**

## **Notes**

* **Ensure all files are placed in their respective directories when deploying the website or running the application.**  
* **The Arduino should be connected and functioning correctly to collect accurate data.**  
* **Dependencies for the Python application are not listed here but must be installed prior to execution.**

**This project combines hardware and software to provide a comprehensive monitoring and detection system for sleep apnea.**
